### 1.0 z-Normalization
Z-normalization is a time series preprocessing step proposed Goldin&Kannelakis whose goal is to enable downstream analyses to focus on the time series structural similarities/differences instead of their amplitude.

    x = seq(0, pi*4, 0.02)
    y = sin(x) * 5 + rnorm(length(x))

    plot(x, y, type="l", col="blue", 
      main="A scaled sine wave with a random noise and its z-normalization")

    lines(x, znorm(y, 0.01), type="l", col="red")
    abline(h=c(1,-1), lty=2, col="gray50")
    legend(0, -4, c("scaled sine wave","z-normalized wave"),
      lty=c(1,1), lwd=c(1,1), col=c("blue","red"), cex=0.8)
